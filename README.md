# Covid-19-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using real-time data. I created interactive visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, and choropleth maps, to show how different countries were affected by the virus on a day-by-day basis. Key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries were tracked and visualized to reveal trends, peak periods, and regional variations. The project helped demonstrate the dynamic nature of the pandemic and highlighted which regions were most impacted over time. Tools used included Python (Pandas, Plotly) and Jupyter Notebook.
